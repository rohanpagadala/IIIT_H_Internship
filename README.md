# IIIT_Hyd_Internship

##Project Overview

This project involves using the Ultralytics YOLOv8 model for image segmentation and video processing.

Task 1: Setup and Image Segmentation
Create and activate a Python virtual environment on a GNU/Linux system.
Install the ultralytics package following the official Ultralytics Quickstart guide.
Test the installation by running a sample segmentation on an online image using the pretrained YOLOv8 model.
Develop a Python script to perform segmentation on a list of local images stored on the computer.


Task 2: Video Segmentation Pipeline
(a) Extend the segmentation code to handle video input.
(b) Download a video clip from YouTube or social media (ensuring the content is appropriate).
(c) Extract frames from the video at regular intervals using ffmpeg.
(d) Perform segmentation on all extracted frames.
(e) Reassemble the segmented frames back into a processed video using ffmpeg.


This project demonstrates practical skills in environment setup, computer vision with YOLOv8, multimedia processing, and automation using Python and command-line tools.
